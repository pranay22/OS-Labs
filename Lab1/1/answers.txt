Question 1.1: If program is executed 100 times PID of parent & child will be different. As at different execution times PID will be different (obviously). 
my_value: Parent prints: 42, Child prints: 18951.
Reason: Process can change their own variables independently and they will change without any noticible effect on other process which are fork() of parent, siblings and descendents.
But OS share pages initially. So we can use mmap() to really share global vars.
