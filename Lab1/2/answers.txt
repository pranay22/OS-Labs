Answer 2.1:
Again the order of parent- and child-thread is not determined. My_value is usually 42 in the parent-thread and 18951 in the child-thread. However in some cases when the child-thread is executed before the parent-thread, my_value is 18951 in the parent thread as well. In those cases the child-thread changed the value before the parent thread is executed and since the memory is shared between both threads the parent-thread reads and prints that value. The pid is the same in both processes. This is due to the fact that both threads belong to the same process and share its pid.
