3.1 - The output is always the same except the values of PID change and my_value for parent is 42 and my_value for child is 18951. 
The order is predefined and does not change because of the waiting time: after both parent and child sleep for 150 ms parent continues
and writes in the pipe whereas the child sleeps for 500 ms and after that reads from the pipe. 

3.2 - 
Cons:
- You need two pipes to achieve full bidirectional communication (pipes are half-duplex).
- It can be a challenge to synchronize threads and depending on the relation model between user-threads 
and kernel-threads it might block the application.
Pros:
 - Multiple read-write is possible and also it can be inherited by the children.
